suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to enhance readability, especially within the bonus section methods.
- The logic in `get_short_info` is slightly complex. You could refactor it to improve readability, perhaps by using a list comprehension and the `join` method more effectively.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities, including the base `Farm` class, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, `get_short_info`, and the `**kwargs` upgrade for `add_animal`. The output matches the expected format. The code directly addresses all instructions in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The use of descriptive variable names and clear indentation contributes to readability. However, more comments, especially in the bonus sections, could further improve understanding.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods like dictionary lookups and string formatting. The `sorted()` function is used appropriately. Performance is generally good for the scale of the problem.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external inputs or operations that could pose security risks. The use of string formatting prevents potential injection vulnerabilities.
