suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain complex logic within the functions.
- The game could be enhanced by adding an option for players to play again after a game ends.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities of a Tic Tac Toe game as described in the chapter, including board representation, display, player input, win/tie checking, and game flow. It fulfills all instructions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the functions are clearly defined. Minor improvements could be made with additional comments for clarification.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the scale of the game. The algorithms used for win and tie checking are straightforward and suitable for a 3x3 board. No performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code includes input validation to ensure that user input is within the valid range and that chosen cells are empty, mitigating potential errors. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities.
