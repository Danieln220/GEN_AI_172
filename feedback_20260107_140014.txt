suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 3 is missing, and because of this the total score is affected.
- In the PetDog class exercise, avoid providing complete code solutions within the instructions. Instead, show only the function signatures or general structure, allowing the student to fill in the implementation details.
- For exercise 1, consider adding comments to explain your code logic, especially for more complex parts or algorithms. Also add comments for exercise 2 and 4

suggestions for improvement:
- In the play method, the *args should be instances of the PetDog class, not just strings.  You should ensure these are Dog objects, or adjust the method accordingly.
- The play method could be improved to handle an arbitrary number of PetDog instances more gracefully. Currently, it tries to print string names mixed with potentially object instances.
- Consider adding error handling or type checking to ensure the `Dog` class is imported correctly.
